# Admin Trade Tracker Telegram Bot ðŸ“ˆ

A powerful yet simple Telegram bot designed to help channel admins log their cryptocurrency trades and allow community members to easily track their performance. It keeps the main channel clean by providing portfolio details via private message.

This bot solves the common problem of trade calls getting lost in a busy chat. Members can instantly check an admin's open positions, entry prices, and live Profit & Loss (PNL) without asking.

# âœ¨ Core Features
- Spot & Futures Separation: Tracks Spot and Futures trades independently

- Position Management: Supports Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) with /buy and taking partial profits with /sell.

- Real-time PNL: Automatically calculates and displays the live Profit & Loss for all open positions using the CoinGecko API.

- Private Portfolio View: Users query the bot in a direct message to see the portfolio, preventing spam in the main channel.

- Admin-Only Controls: Only the designated channel admin can execute trade management commands

- Persistent Storage: Uses an SQLite database to remember all trades, so no data is lost if the bot restarts.
